Karele-v1.0Final
================

Creates a square and fill it with a bunch of rules.
It's a python 3 script which simulates a game based
on filling a n*n square with consecutive numbers
from 1 to n by keeping up the following rules:

	- 2 spaces between the horizontal or vertical moves
	- 1 space between the diagonal moves

The script does not guarantee to fill all the cells,
it only fills them within orders randomly.

By default, it creates a 6*6 square and fills it with
the specified rules. You can easily change the last
line to do this process for n*n square.


v1.0 Updates:

    - Class Structure
    - Saving the report a .txt file
    - Script tries until the square is full
    - Displaying number of tries and script time
